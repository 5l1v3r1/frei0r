** What Frei0r is

This is frei0r - a minimalistic plugin API for video effects.

The main emphasis  is on simplicity for an API that  will round up the
most common video effects into simple filters, sources and mixers that
can be controlled by parameters.

It's our hope that this way these simple effects can be shared between
many  applications,  avoiding   their  reimplementation  by  different
projects.

** What Frei0r is not

This is  not meant as a  competing standard to  more ambitious efforts
that try to satisfy the  needs of many different applications and more
complex effects.

Eventually  the  frei0r  API  can  be wrapped  by  higher  level  APIs
expanding its functionalities (for instance, gstreamer does).

Frei0r  has been around  since 2006,  born from  yearly brainstormings
held at the  [[http://www.piksel.no][Piksel]] conference with the participation  of various free
and open source video software developers.

It is mostly adopted on GNU/Linux and OSX platforms, counts more than
80  effects implemented  and is  used  by free  video applications  as
[[http://www.gephex.org/][Gephex]],  [[http://lives.sf.net][LiVES]],  [[http://freej.dyne.org][FreeJ]], [[http://mob.bek.no/][MÃ¸B]],  [[http://veejayhq.net][VeeJay]],  [[http://openmovieeditor.sourceforge.net/][Open  Movie Editor]],  [[http://www.artefacte.org/pd/][pdvjtools]],
[[http://www.freenet.org.nz/dvedit][DVEdit]], [[http://www.mltframework.org/][MLT]] and [[http://www.kdenlive.org/][KDEnLive]] among the others.

Developers  are sporadically  contributing and  we are  happy  if more
people like to get involved, spare some code and port new effects, for
instance there  is a lot of code  to be ported from  [[http://effectv.sf.net][EffecTV]], the [[http://demo-effects.sourceforge.net/][Demo
Effects  Collection]], [[ftp://ftp.dyne.org/freej/plugins/petespluginslinux_070114.tar.gz][Pete's  plugins]] and  the XScreensavers...  let us
now!


* Download

** Debian / Ubuntu

Binary packages  are mantained  for Debian ([[http://packages.qa.debian.org/f/frei0r.html][QA]])  and Ubuntu  ([[http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?searchon=names&keywords=frei0r][pkg]]), to
install the stable version distributed use *apt-get* or *synaptic*:

:  sudo apt-get install frei0r-plugins

** Source code

The  latest  source for  frei0r  plugins  can  be attained  using  our
revisioning system *GIT*

:  git clone git://code.dyne.org/frei0r.git

Daily  snapshots  are also  packed  ready  to  "./configure; make"  on
[[http://ftp.dyne.org/frei0r/][FTP.dyne.org]]


* Documentation

If you  are new to frei0r (but  not to programming) the  best thing is
probably to  have a look at  the [[/codedoc/html/frei0r_8h-source.html][frei0r header]], which  is quite simple
and well documented

After that,  you might want  to look at  the frei0r functions  in more
detail and have a look at the existing effects.

The sourcecode is well  commented: see its full [[http://frei0r.dyne.org/codedoc/html][doxyfied documentation]]
online.

** C++ Filter example

A simple skeleton for a frei0r video filter looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC c++
#include <frei0r.hpp>

typedef struct {
  int16_t w, h;
  uint8_t bpp;
  uint32_t size;
} ScreenGeometry;

class MyExample: public frei0r::filter {
public:
  MyExample(int wdt, int hgt);
  ~MyExample();
  virtual void update();
private:
  ScreenGeometry geo;
  void _init(int wdt, int hgt);
}

MyExample::MyExample() { /* constructor */ }
MyExample::~MyExample() { /* destructor */ }

void MyExample::_init(int wdt, int hgt) {
  geo.w = wdt;
  geo.h = hgt;
  geo.bpp = 32; // this filter works only in RGBA 32bit
  geo.size = geo.w*geo.h*(geo.bpp/8); // calculate the size in bytes
}

void MyExample::update() {
  // we get video input via buffer pointer (void*)in 
  uint32_t *src = (uint32_t*)in;
  // and we give video output via buffer pointer (void*)out
  uint32_t *dst = (uint32_t*)out;
  // this example here does just a copy of input to output
  memcpy(dst, src, geo.size);
}
  
frei0r::construct<MyExample>
        plugin("MyExample", "short and simple description for my example",
	       "Who did it", 1, 0);

* Communication

You  can get  in touch  with our  developer community,  send  your new
effects and share your intentions with us.

We have a  free mailinglist open to subscription  on [[https://piksel.no/mailman/listinfo/frei0r-devel][frei0r-devel]] with
[[http://piksel.no/pipermail/frei0r-devel/][public archives]] that are also indexed by popular search engines.
