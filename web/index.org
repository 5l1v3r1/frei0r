** What Frei0r is

This is frei0r - a minimalistic plugin API for video effects.

The  main  emphasis  is  on  simplicity -  there  are  many  different
applications  that use  video  effects, and  they  all have  different
requirements  regarding  their internal  plugin  API.  And that's  why
frei0r does not  try to be a one-in-all general  video plugin API, but
instead  an API  for the  most common  video effects:  simple filters,
sources and mixers that can be controlled by parameters.

It's our hope that this way these simple effects can be shared between
many  applications,  avoiding   their  reimplementation  by  different
projects.

** What Frei0r is not

On the other  hand, this is not meant as a  competing standard to more
ambitious  efforts that  try to  satisfy the  needs of  many different
applications and more complex effects.

** Overview

If you  are new to frei0r (but  not to programming) the  best thing is
probably to have a look at the [[/codedoc/html/frei0r_8h-source.html][frei0r header]], which is quite simple.

After that,  you might want  to look at  the frei0r functions  in more
detail.

When developing a new frei0r effect, you have to choose

 - which effect type to use (Type of the Plugin),
 - which color model to use (Color Models), and
 - which parameter types (Parameter Types) your effect will support.

To round things up, you  should decide whether your effect should have
an associated  icon (Icons for frei0r  effects), and where  it will be
installed (Plugin Locations).
