Installation Instructions
*************************

Frei0r can be built using either Autoconf or CMake.

The choice is open, CMake is mandatory only on Windowz.

The presence of optional libraries on the system will trigger compilation
of extra plugins. These libraries are:

  + [Gavl] ( required for scale0tilt and vectorscope filters )
    [Gavl]: http://gmerlin.sourceforge.net

  + [OpenCV] (required for facebl0r filter )
    [OpenCV]: http://opencvlibrary.sourceforge.net

  + [Cairo] (required for cairo- filters and mixers )
    [Cairo]: http://cairographics.org

= Autoconf build

./configure
make

= CMake build

cmake .
make


= Install

Default prefix is /usr/local
Target directory is frei0r-1

Hence a default install will put the plugins into /usr/local/lib/frei0r-1
unless the prefix path is specified. Most applications will look into that
directory on GNU/Linux, or it should be possible to configure where to
look for frei0r plugins.

When using Apple/OSX, the dlopen() mechanism (in FFMpeg for instance)
will look for .dylib extensions and not the .so that frei0r plugins
have by default. To fix this problem one can rename the plugins simply so:

for file in /usr/local/lib/frei0r-1/*.so ; do
  cp $file "${file%.*}.dylib"
done
